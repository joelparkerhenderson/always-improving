## Introduction

The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli was published around 1532, about half a decade after Machiavelli’s death and soon gained popularity as a controversial advice book written for rulers. It is cleverly written and offers quite valuable guidance for everyone who intends to rule people and an entity ever in life.

While most people take it to be a book for political leaders and rulers only, the advice in it applies to leaders in any aspect and capacity, even at a household level.


## A Summary Of The Book

The first half of The Prince deals with different types of state and how to effectively deal with any sort of troubles faced by states as well as tips on successfully conquering them by extracting examples from contemporary and ancient history. Trouble in a state as Machiavelli states is synonymous to ‘tuberculosis’- difficult to identify in the start, but easy to treat. However, it becomes really difficult to treat as it progresses, but definitely easy to diagnose then. While reading the book, one starts thinking of the rulers in his/ her state and cannot help but draw a comparison between them and those mentioned in the book.

In the book, Machiavelli establishes that to successfully conquer hereditary principates, the conqueror needs to establish a colony there and then add territory in it with force. He mentions the example of Alexander the Great and praises his tactics of conquering lands and expanding his territories.

He also draws a distinction between the different governing subjects who were ruled tyrannically and those who knew how self-government works. He believes those who were ruled dictatorially won’t be easy to win over, but will be easier to govern once conquered whereas those who are accustomed to self-government won’t be very easy to rule.

The book also moves on to describe the characteristics of a good, honest and successful ruler. A good ruler that a state deserves must be compassionate and kind enough to be empathetic towards his/ her people and extend kindness towards them. He/ she needs to be aware of the sufferings of people in the state and needs to be humane enough to take action regarding it. The ruler must also be very honest and fair in all his/ her dealings and work with dedication to serve the people.

He also discusses and criticizes all the rulers who gain power via military help, but aren’t able to establish their authority because they haven’t conquered the land themselves.

From chapter 12 up to chapter 14, Machiavelli talks about how leaders should treat enemies and believes that must be done through military power and the use of mercenary arms must be restricted.

In the later chapters, he talks about how a leader must fairly treat his subjects and then discusses how the leaders must be prepared for worst case scenarios and shouldn’t lose power due to fortune.

As he writes, “it is better to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a woman, and if one wishes to keep her down, it is necessary to beat her and knock her down.”

The Prince is quite a gripping read, one which opens your eyes to the many politics being played in the state by the rulers themselves and also gives insight into some important lessons which we need to apply to our life and dealings with others to live better.


## Important lessons

Be Present in the Moment: It teaches us the importance of being mindful of the present and living in it because when you are actually present in the moment, you can identify many problems on time before they get worse or out of hand. Awareness is the key to resolving issues and that is only possible if you live in the moment. Like a sentence from the book reads: "... if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them."

Be Careful when Trusting People: Man cannot function successfully alone. We need a team to grow and succeed in life. That said, you need to be very cautious of the people you trust and of those you decide to work for you because a single dishonest person can be your downfall. According to Machiavelli, "A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savor of it."

Be Proactive and Prepared for Worst Case Scenarios: Being proactive helps you to mitigate the problems that arise because of the unexpected. While preparing to win, do consider worst case scenarios and prepare for them beforehand. Like Machiavelli writes in the book, "A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune changes, it may find him prepared to resist her blows."
