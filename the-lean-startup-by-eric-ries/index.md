## The Book’s Main Idea

The book’s main goal is to help readers avoid the number one mistake that makes start-ups fail i.e. launching a product or a service without the entrepreneur knowing who the product’s customer is and what those customers really want.

To quote the author:

“Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem.”

The Lean Start-up focuses on teaching readers how to better their start-up businesses by exposing them to a new way of thinking that is able to mitigate their risk going forward which automatically increases their likelihood of finding a product that sticks. The book does that through introducing the readers to a systematic and scientific method that enables them to get all the information they need to make fast and decisive decisions when starting a business.

“The ability to learn faster from customers is the essential competitive advantage that start-ups must possess.”


## First phase: VISION

In the book, Reis, through his experience, explains why start-ups fail. He tries to make readers understand that the battle for a successful start-up is first lost in the vision where entrepreneurs follow a conventional approach of starting a business; which dictates that immediately they get an idea and it has been approved by either their friends or family, the idea becomes legit and ready to be launched in the market.

According to the Lean Start-up, the conventional approach is wrong because it makes entrepreneurs launch start-ups based on untested assumptions, which increase the possibility of them creating a perfect product that nobody wants.

Reis says that the first goal of a start-up is to figure out the right thing to build, the thing that customers will want and will be willing to pay for as quickly as possible.

Under the topic of vision, Reis teaches the readers how to kick start a start-up the right way. He uses a super formula, which makes the reader better at starting a successful business. Here is a glimpse of the formula.

* Step 1: The reader is taught how to come up with a user experience vision.

* Step 2: The reader is taught how to identify critical assumptions on their idea, which determines the success of the start-up.

* Step 3: The reader is educated on how to experiment with critical assumptions. Here, Reis uses the Zappos example where he explains how Nick Swinmurn, the inventor of Zappos, came up with a successful business by simply experimenting with his assumption, ‘people can buy shoes online’ by first posting photos of shoes online to test customer demand.

* Step 4: The reader is taught how to build an MVP (minimum viable product)- A sample of the reader’s product that highlights the main features of their idea but takes less time, effort and money to build, that they can use to test their idea with.


## Second phase: STEER

This phase the book focuses on teaching the reader how to steer his/her start-up business through using the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop formula.

In the book, Reis says the lean start-up methodology is based on a cycle of rinse and repeat; the build-measure-learn. What the reader is taught from the steer phase is how:

  * He can identify the leap of faith assumption from his idea.

  * He can use various methods to test his assumptions.

  * He can release his product to the market.

  * He can learn to define his baseline metric of judging the performance of his product to the market and how he can use it to measure his products success or failure.

  * He can assess his products results and know whether to pivot (adjust to a better one) or persevere (retain the idea).


## Third phase: ACCELERATE

In the book, Reis uses the vision and steer phases to set a foundation for the reader’s last move to take to have a successful start-up, which is acceleration. In acceleration, Reis teaches the reader how he can move past the feedback loop faster and go on to set the innovation and growth ball rolling.

Under accelerate Reis focuses on teaching the reader the following topics.

  * BATCH- This part explains how the reader can use a small batch approach to get his product going as soon as possible. The author goes on to say that smaller batches work better for lean start-ups because they enable the entrepreneur to detect a problem early as well as enable him to get quick feedback from a customer.

  * GROW- In this section, the author teaches readers how to identify and concentrate on the right growth strategy for their start-ups. To illustrate how important a right growth strategy is, Reis gives an example of how Sabeer Bhatia, the owner of Hotmail, grew the business by figuring out her best growth strategy, which was adding signature that carried the message, “Get your free e-mail at Hotmail” onto every outgoing email.

  * ADAPT- This part teaches the reader how to develop an adaptive culture using the ‘five why’s system’.

  * INNOVATE- This part teaches readers how to set up their start-up as an innovative company that has an organized way of producing new-innovations and start-ups.


## Conclusion

The big take away from the book, ‘The Lean Start-up’ is; entrepreneurship is management so for the reader to succeed in it, they need to manage their start-up business as the institution it is and avoid jumping head first into ideas.
