## The Book’s Main Idea

Mental models are the book’s big idea. Kaufman notes that once you understand your mental models, the framework that defines how you learn anything, you can learn any business related skill and core business concepts and frameworks.

By understanding and applying mental models, a universal framework by which we learn important business concepts, we rapidly improve our ability to understand, learn, and tackle complex business disciplines or frameworks.

The foundational mental models Kaufman discusses in the book are (1) Value creation, (2) Marketing, (3) Sales, (4) Value delivery, and (5) Finance. Each of these models focuses on core business concepts, principles, and vocabularies.

“Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they're willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser's needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.”

“Business schools don't create successful people. They simply accept them, and then take credit for their success.”


## 1: Understand and utilize your mental faculties

The functionalities of our brains influence our ability to learn core business disciplines, principles, systems, and processes. How capable we are of utilizing our mental faculties in relation to learning core business processes, principles, and models largely depends on a concept Kaufman calls the “Gas Tank.”

For your brain to work at optimal levels, your “gas tank,” or your energy levels, must remain optimal at all times. To keep the ‘gas tank’ full, the author recommends a proper diet—eating healthy and balanced meals in the right proportion to your energy needs—exercising—exercise every day—direct sunlight—and adequate sleep—getting 7-8 hours of quality sleep every night.

Most of the “gas tank” strategies recommended by the author require willpower, which has limitations and is not easy to practice. To circumvent this, i.e. our limited reserves of willpower, Kaufman suggests changing our environment—instead of our behavior—using a structured model. For instance, if you want to lose weight and ice cream is your kryptonite, instead of forcing yourself to stop eating ice cream, change your environment by avoiding its purchase altogether.

“Save your Willpower: focus on using it to change your Environment, and you’ll have more available to use whenever Inhibition is necessary”


## 2: Before you work with others, learn how to work with yourself

Businesses are about interpersonal relationships and the ability to collaborate well with others to achieve a mutual goal. Effective collaboration with others demands that you first learn how to work with yourself, of which to do, you must first learn how to get into a ‘state of flow’, or as the author calls it, ‘how to implement the concept of mono-idealism,’ the ability to focus all your attention and energy on one aspect of your business/learning process.

To utilize mono-idealism and attain a state of flow—Kaufman notes it takes the mind about 10-30 minutes to get into flow—he suggests eliminating all forms of interruptions or distraction from the working/learning environment.

To eliminate distractions and interruptions, he offers suggestions such as muting all notifications, disconnecting from the internet, and working in ‘dashes,’ 10-30 minutes of focused, committed work. He also mentions mindfulness and focused meditation as a way to increase attention and the ability to experience flow.

On working effectively on your own, Kaufman introduces the idea of MIT (Most Important Task), a concept whose main idea is to create a To-do list consisting of two to three important tasks you want to complete by day’s end. He goes on to note that attaching a deadline to each of these tasks improves focus and overall productivity.


## Conclusion

“New skills create new opportunities, and new opportunities often translate into more income”

To learn new skills—or accomplish anything worthwhile for that matter—write down your goal, use one sentence to describe the motivation behind the aim (the desired outcome), create a list of necessary action steps, and track your progress using a trusted system.
