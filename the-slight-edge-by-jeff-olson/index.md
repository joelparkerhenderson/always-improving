## Chapter 3: The Choice

In this chapter, Olson talks about how simple positive daily activities if done regularly and consistently can help create a compound effect over time. Doing something once or twice never gets you anywhere close to your goals because the effect of such actions wears off quite soon.

We know everything we really need to know, but what is lacking is the ability to take meaningful action on a consistent basis. We are scared of working hard every single day and that is precisely what keeps us from growing forward and better in life.

The second part of the book includes the following chapters:
